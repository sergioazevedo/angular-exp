NOTE -- Showdown on GitHub
==========================

**Please note** that I, Corey, am not the author of Showdown. Rather, I found it
some time back at <http://attacklab.net/showdown/>
(website removed, see: <http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://attacklab.net/showdown>)
and wanted to see it available on GitHub.

All credit and praise for authoring this library should go to John Fraser.

Oh, and John Gruber of course.

That said, I have recently see some GitHub forking activity and a pull
request. As such, I will endeavor to ordain myself as a maintainer of
Showdown, at least as it exists on GitHub.

Apologies for any confusion or perceived misinformation.

Cheers,<br/>
Corey
